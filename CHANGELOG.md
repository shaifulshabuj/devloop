## [4.8.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- **3-phase fix escalation** in `devloop run` — replaces the hard "max retries" exit
  with a graduated recovery strategy:
  - **Phase 1** (rounds 1..N/2): standard fix — latest review fed to worker (unchanged)
  - **Phase 2** (rounds N/2+1..N): deep fix — all accumulated review history injected
    so the worker understands why previous fixes failed and takes a different approach
  - **Phase 3** (after N rounds): re-architect — the spec is redesigned using all failure
    context, then a fresh work + review cycle runs (up to 2 additional attempts)
- `DEVLOOP_FIX_STRATEGY` config variable (`escalate` default | `standard` = old behaviour)
- `--no-respec` flag on `devloop run` — skip Phase 3 (re-architect) for a single run
- `cmd_fix --history <text>` — optional flag to inject accumulated review history into the fix prompt
- `_run_respec_phase()` internal helper — handles Phase 3 re-architect flow
- Help text: new **FIX ESCALATION STRATEGY** section documents phases, config, and flags

### Changed
- `devloop run` usage line updated to include `--no-respec` flag
- Fix loop stage label now reflects current phase: "standard", "deep", or "re-architect"

---

## [4.7.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- **Provider-aware session launch** — `devloop start` and `devloop daemon` now
  respect `DEVLOOP_MAIN_PROVIDER` and launch the correct provider session:
  - **Claude** (default): unchanged — `claude --remote-control "DevLoop: <name>"`
    with orchestrator agent. Access from claude.ai/code or the Claude mobile app.
  - **Copilot**: launches `copilot` interactive mode locally. Orchestrator agent
    context is injected as initial prompt. Note: Copilot CLI has no remote-control
    equivalent; the session runs in the local terminal only.

### Changed
- `_launch_claude()` renamed to `_launch_session()` (dispatches by provider);
  `_launch_claude_session()` and `_launch_copilot_session()` are the per-provider
  implementations.
- `cmd_start` connect-from messaging is now conditional per provider:
  - Claude → mobile app + claude.ai/code links
  - Copilot → "terminal session only" notice with hint to use Claude for remote access
- `cmd_daemon` messaging likewise conditional; warns when Copilot is main provider
  (daemon restarts local session; no remote control available).
- Help text (`devloop help`, `devloop start --help`) updated to document
  per-provider session capabilities.

---

## [4.6.3] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- **Natural language mode** — `devloop` now understands plain English commands:
  - `devloop do <task>` — new first-class command (aliases: `ask`, `please`, `nl`).
    Joins all args as-is into a task description, no quoting required.
    Example: `devloop do check the latest progress and work on remaining tasks`
  - **Auto-detection** — when a "utility" command (`check`, `update`, `status`,
    `start`, `doctor`, etc.) is followed by plain-English words (not `--flags` or
    `TASK-` IDs), DevLoop automatically routes to the NL pipeline instead of the
    literal command. Fixes: `devloop check the latest progress...` no longer
    triggered the version checker.
  - Unknown multi-word commands also route to NL pipeline with a helpful tip.

---

## [4.6.2] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- `devloop check` / `devloop update`: version check and script download now use
  `gh api` / `gh release download` (authenticated) when `gh` CLI is available —
  fixes "Could not determine remote version" on **private repos** where unauthenticated
  `curl` gets a 404 from GitHub API. Falls back to curl for public repos.

---

## [4.6.1] — 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- `devloop init`: fixed `_args[@]: unbound variable` crash on Bash 3.2 (macOS default)
  when no extra arguments are passed — empty array expansion under `set -u` now
  uses `[[ ${#_args[@]} -gt 0 ]]` guard instead of bare `"${_args[@]}"`

---

## [4.6.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- **Interactive setup wizard** — `devloop init` now runs a 4-step interactive wizard on first initialization:
  1. **Main provider** — choose claude or copilot (detects what's installed)
  2. **Worker provider** — choose copilot, claude, opencode, or pi
  3. **Claude models** — separate model for main roles vs worker roles (sonnet / opus / haiku)
  4. **Permission mode** — smart / auto / strict / off
- Wizard detects installed providers and marks them `✔ installed` or `⚠ not found`.
- Selections are saved directly to `devloop.config.sh` — no manual editing required.
- **`devloop init --yes` / `-y`** — skip wizard, use auto-detected defaults (CI-friendly).
- **`devloop init --configure` / `-c`** — re-run wizard on an already-initialized project.
- **`devloop configure`** (aliases: `setup`, `wizard`) — standalone command to re-run the wizard anytime.
  After wizard completes, regenerates agent prompt files automatically.
- Updated SETUP section in `devloop help` with new wizard-aware instructions and correct GitHub raw URL.

### Changed
- `_write_default_config`: `CLAUDE_MAIN_MODEL` and `CLAUDE_WORKER_MODEL` are now initially commented-out hints in the template — the wizard writes them when chosen.

---

## [4.5.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- **`CLAUDE_MAIN_MODEL`** — separate model setting for architect/reviewer/orchestrator (main) roles. Overrides `CLAUDE_MODEL` when set.
- **`CLAUDE_WORKER_MODEL`** — separate model setting for worker/fix roles. Overrides `CLAUDE_MODEL` when set.
- Backward-compatible: `CLAUDE_MODEL` still works as a shared default for both roles.
- Example config: `CLAUDE_MAIN_MODEL="opus"` (quality reviews) + `CLAUDE_WORKER_MODEL="sonnet"` (fast implementation)
- **`devloop status`** now shows which Claude model each role uses.
- **`devloop help`** has a new **MODEL CONFIGURATION** section explaining model settings and the Copilot model limitation.
- **`devloop agent-sync`** context file now documents active models per role and Copilot model note.
- **`_refresh_project_for_version()`** now uses the correct per-role models when refreshing agent prompts.
- **Copilot model documentation** throughout: Copilot CLI has no `--model` flag; model is set at `github.com/settings/copilot`.

### Changed
- `devloop.config.sh` template now has `CLAUDE_MAIN_MODEL` and `CLAUDE_WORKER_MODEL` as documented (commented-out) overrides.

---

## [4.4.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- **GitHub-native version checking** — `devloop check` and `devloop update` now work out-of-the-box with no configuration. Uses the GitHub Releases API (`/releases/latest`) automatically; `DEVLOOP_VERSION_URL` / `DEVLOOP_SOURCE_URL` are still honoured as overrides.
- **`DEVLOOP_GITHUB_REPO`** built-in default (`shaifulshabuj/devloop`) — forks can override this single variable to point all version/update machinery at their own repo.
- **`_gh_latest_version()`** — queries GitHub releases API and extracts semver; uses `python3` JSON parsing with a `grep` fallback.
- **Version hint banner** — `devloop start` and `devloop run` now show a non-blocking update notice the next time they run after a new release is detected in the background.
- **`_refresh_project_for_version()`** — after `devloop update`, automatically refreshes Claude hooks, agent prompt files, the `CLAUDE.md` managed block, and merges any new default config keys into `devloop.config.sh`. Safe to re-run (idempotent).
- **Updated `devloop doctor` version check** — uses GitHub API by default; no longer skips with "DEVLOOP_VERSION_URL not set" message.
- **`cmd_help` improvements** — `check` and `update` descriptions now accurately state no config is required.

### Fixed
- Stray extra `}` in `cmd_check()` body (syntax error from prior refactor).
- `cmd_update` config template comments updated to reflect that URL overrides are optional, not required.

---

## [4.3.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- **`devloop run` (alias: `go`)** — full automated pipeline in one command: `architect → work → review → [fix → review]* → learn`. Replaces the need to manually chain 4–6 commands per task. Supports `--type`, `--files`, `--max-retries` (default 3), `--no-learn` flags.
- **`devloop queue` (alias: `q`)** — batch task management. Queue multiple tasks with `queue add`, inspect with `queue list`, run them all sequentially with `queue run` (supports `--stop-on-fail`), and `queue clear`. Failed tasks stay in queue for retry. Queue stored in `.devloop/queue.txt`.
- **Natural language routing** — unknown multi-word commands (e.g. `devloop add a dark mode toggle`) automatically route to `devloop run` with a tip to use the explicit form next time.
- **Improved unknown-command UX** — single-word unknown commands now show a helpful tip suggesting `devloop run` instead of dumping the full help text.

---

## [4.2.0] — 2026-05-09

### Added
- **Smart permission gate** (`devloop hooks`): Claude `PreToolUse` hook classifies every Bash command — BLOCK dangerous commands (`rm -rf /`, `curl|bash`, etc.), ALLOW known-safe commands (git, pytest, npm test, make, linters), ESCALATE unknowns (asks user via tty → osascript dialog → queue file → auto-deny)
- **`devloop permit` command**: inspect and manage the permission gate with `status`, `watch`, `grant`, `deny`, `log`, `mode` subcommands
- **PostToolUse audit log**: every tool call recorded to `.devloop/permissions.log`
- **Permission modes**: `smart` (default), `auto`, `strict`, `off` — set via `DEVLOOP_PERMISSION_MODE`
- **Permission escalation timeout**: `DEVLOOP_PERMISSION_TIMEOUT` (default: 60s) before auto-deny

### Fixed
- **Copilot non-interactive permission wall**: all `copilot` invocations now use `--allow-all-tools --allow-all-paths -p "<prompt>"` — fixes "Permission denied and could not request permission from user" that blocked workers and reviewers in pipe mode
- **Copilot `-p` flag syntax**: corrected from `echo ... | copilot -p` (broken) to `copilot -p "$prompt"` (correct — `-p` is a required argument, not a stdin flag)
- **Claude worker tool scope**: `cmd_work` and `cmd_fix` now pass `--allowedTools` to `claude -p` workers to restrict to file ops, git, and test runners
- **Claude reviewer tool scope**: `run_provider_prompt` uses read-only tool set for architect/reviewer roles
- **Auto-recovery messaging**: removed stale "re-test after 6h" — recovery is probe-based (`DEVLOOP_PROBE_INTERVAL` minutes, default 5)

### Documentation
- README: expanded `devloop hooks` (all 7 hooks + permission tier table), new `devloop permit` section, updated file structure with hook scripts and permission files, updated `.gitignore` recommendations
- USAGE.md: new Scenario 6 — Smart Permissions end-to-end walkthrough; updated Scenario 2 hooks step; expanded Quick Reference

---

## [4.1.0] — 2026-05-09

### Changed

- `devloop init` now auto-populates stack/config values from project analysis in the first run and reports the auto-config update count.
- README and USAGE docs updated for auto-analysis-first setup flow.
- VERSION bumped to `4.1.0`.

---

## [4.0.0] — 2026-05-09

### Changed

- `devloop init` now merges/upserts existing project files instead of skipping them:
  - `devloop.config.sh`: appends missing default keys without overwriting existing values.
  - `CLAUDE.md`: updates/inserts the DevLoop-managed block (`DEVLOOP:CLAUDE` markers) while preserving custom content.
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`: updates/inserts the DevLoop-managed block (`DEVLOOP:COPILOT` markers) while preserving custom content.
- `devloop init` now analyzes the current project to auto-populate placeholder config fields (`PROJECT_STACK`, `PROJECT_PATTERNS`, `PROJECT_CONVENTIONS`, `TEST_FRAMEWORK`).
- VERSION bumped to `4.0.0`.

---

## [3.1.0] — Tools, Skills & MCP Management

### Added

**`devloop tools` command family — project-level tooling management**

- `devloop tools audit` — full inventory: global vs project MCP servers, skills, plugins, hooks, and Copilot instructions. Shows gaps and sync status at a glance.
- `devloop tools suggest` — reads `PROJECT_STACK` from `devloop.config.sh` and recommends MCP servers, Claude plugins, skills, and Copilot path instructions tailored to the stack.
- `devloop tools add` — interactive numbered picker; installs selected tools. Also supports non-interactive flags: `--mcp`, `--skill`, `--instruction`, `--plugin`.
- `devloop tools sync` — prompts to copy global MCP servers (`~/.claude.json`) and skills (`~/.claude/skills/`) to project level per item.

**Dual MCP config writing (Claude + Copilot)**
- `_add_mcp_to_project()` writes MCP servers to **both** `.mcp.json` (Claude; `mcpServers` key) and `.vscode/mcp.json` (Copilot/VS Code; `servers` key with `type: stdio`) in one call, auto-translating schemas.

**Claude skill scaffolding**
- `_scaffold_skill()` creates `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with a structured template.

**Copilot path-specific instructions**
- `_add_path_instruction()` creates `.github/instructions/<name>.instructions.md` with YAML frontmatter `applyTo` glob, which Copilot applies in addition to the repo-wide instructions.

**`cmd_doctor` tools section**
- Reports MCP server count (global / project), VS Code MCP count, skill count, and path instruction count. Links to `devloop tools audit` and `devloop tools suggest`.

**Colors**
- Added `BLUE` and `MAGENTA` ANSI variables for tool-type badges in suggest/add output.

### Changed
- `devloop init` next-steps now includes step 4: "Run `devloop tools suggest` for stack-specific tool recommendations."
- VERSION bumped to `3.1.0`.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added

**Self-improvement: `devloop learn` command**
- Extracts lessons from review cycles and appends them to `CLAUDE.md` under `## Learned Patterns`
- Claude reads these patterns in future sessions, making the pipeline progressively smarter
- CLAUDE.md template updated with `## Learned Patterns` section placeholder

**Version awareness: `devloop check` command + auto hint**
- `devloop check` — checks manifest URL for newer version and prints update instructions
- `devloop start` runs a silent background version check; shows a hint on the next start if an update is available
- New config: `DEVLOOP_VERSION_URL` pointing to a plain-text semver manifest file

**Claude Code hooks: `devloop hooks` command**
- Generates `.claude/settings.json` registering all 4 pipeline hook events
- Writes 4 executable hook scripts to `.claude/hooks/`:
  - `devloop-stop.sh` — logs task summary on `Stop` event
  - `devloop-subagent-stop.sh` — records subagent completion and verdict keywords
  - `devloop-notification.sh` — saves Claude notifications to `.devloop/notifications.log`
  - `devloop-session.sh` — records session start/end to `.devloop/sessions.log`
- Orchestrator agent updated with mobile push notification guidance

**Pipeline log viewer: `devloop logs` command**
- Views pipeline, notification, and session logs collected by hooks
- Usage: `devloop logs [pipeline|notifications|sessions]`

**Health check: `devloop doctor` command**
- Validates all DevLoop dependencies: `claude` auth, `copilot` auth, `gh` auth, git config, agent files, config validity, version currency
- Prints ✔/✖ for each check with actionable fix hints

**GitHub Actions integration: `devloop ci` command**
- Generates `.github/workflows/devloop-review.yml` for CI-triggered PR review
- Uses `anthropics/claude-code-action` — requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret in repo

**Copilot coding agent: `github-agent` worker mode**
- New `DEVLOOP_WORKER_MODE` config: `cli` (default) or `github-agent`
- In `github-agent` mode, `devloop work` creates a GitHub Issue with the spec, waits for Copilot's cloud agent to open a PR
- `devloop init` generates `copilot-setup-steps.yml` when `DEVLOOP_WORKER_MODE=github-agent`
- New config: `DEVLOOP_VERSION_URL` for update checking

### Changed

- `devloop.config.sh` template updated with `DEVLOOP_WORKER_MODE` and `DEVLOOP_VERSION_URL` defaults
- `CLAUDE.md` template updated with cleaner system section and `## Learned Patterns` placeholder
- `cmd_help` updated with all new commands and worker mode documentation
- `README.md` updated with all new commands, worker modes, and expanded file structure
- `devloop init` next-steps guidance updated to include `devloop hooks`

---

## [2.1.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added

**Architecture & data flow diagrams**
- Added [`DEVLOOP-GRAPH.md`](./DEVLOOP-GRAPH.md) — 11 detailed Mermaid diagrams covering the full pipeline, every command, file lifecycle, git baseline mechanism, `devloop work` and `devloop review` prompt structure, daemon auto-restart loop, status state machine, agent collaboration map, and `devloop clean` selection logic

**Linux systemd support (FIX #15)**
- `devloop daemon` now registers a `~/.config/systemd/user/devloop-<project>.service` unit on Linux
- Service starts automatically on user login (`WantedBy=default.target`) and restarts on crash (`Restart=on-failure`)
- `devloop daemon uninstall` removes the unit on both macOS and Linux
- Internal helpers `_write_systemd` and `_remove_systemd` added alongside existing `_write_launchd` / `_remove_launchd`

**`devloop open` command · alias `o` (FIX #12)**
- Opens the task spec file in `$EDITOR` (falls back to `$VISUAL`, then `vi`)
- Works with latest task or a named `TASK-ID`

**`devloop block` command · alias `b` (FIX #12)**
- Prints the Copilot Instructions Block extracted from a spec
- Useful for manually pasting into Copilot chat without running the full pipeline
- Reads from the pre-extracted `.devloop/prompts/TASK-ID-copilot.txt` when available

**`devloop clean` command (FIX #13)**
- Removes finalized (approved/rejected) specs older than N days (default: 30)
- `--days N` flag to customize the age threshold
- `--dry-run` flag to preview removals without making changes
- Pending and needs-work tasks are always preserved
- Cleans all related files per task: spec `.md`, review `.md`, `.pre-commit` baseline, `-copilot.txt` prompt

**`devloop update` command (FIX #14)**
- Self-upgrades the devloop binary from `DEVLOOP_SOURCE_URL`
- Shows a diff before applying so you can review what changed
- Backs up current binary to `devloop.sh.bak`
- Prints clear setup instructions when `DEVLOOP_SOURCE_URL` is not configured

**Git baseline for precise review diffs (FIX #1)**
- `devloop work` now records the current `HEAD` hash to `.devloop/specs/TASK-ID.pre-commit` before launching Copilot
- `devloop review` uses this baseline to `git diff base..HEAD` — sees exactly what Copilot changed across one or more commits
- `devloop fix` updates the baseline after Copilot's fix commit so the next review only diffs the new changes
- Falls back to uncommitted `git diff` if no baseline file exists

**Full spec delivered to Copilot (FIX #10)**
- `devloop work` now sends the complete spec file (all sections) instead of only the condensed Instructions Block
- Copilot now receives: Files to Touch, Implementation Steps, Edge Cases, Test Scenarios, and the Instructions Block

**Runtime context prepended to Copilot prompt (FIX #11)**
- `devloop work` prepends live project context from `devloop.config.sh` (stack, patterns, conventions, test framework, commit format) at the top of every Copilot prompt
- Context is printed to the terminal as `Runtime context → Stack: ... | Tests: ...` so it is visible in devloop output
- Ensures Copilot always has up-to-date conventions even on re-runs after config changes

**Rich `.github/copilot-instructions.md` template (FIX #9 + FIX #11)**
- `devloop init` now writes a detailed Copilot instructions file with live stack values, commit format, and a pre-flight checklist
- Includes: stack, patterns, conventions, test framework, commit message format (`feat(TASK-ID): ...`), and implementation checklist

**Spec completeness validation (FIX #7)**
- `devloop work` refuses to launch Copilot if the spec is missing the `## Copilot Instructions Block` section
- Prints a clear error with the regeneration command

**Seconds-precision task IDs (FIX #3)**
- Task IDs now use `TASK-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` format (6-digit time) instead of `TASK-YYYYMMDD-HHMM`
- Eliminates collisions when two specs are created in the same minute

**Dynamic agent model from config (FIX #5)**
- `devloop-architect.md` and `devloop-reviewer.md` are generated with the `CLAUDE_MODEL` value from `devloop.config.sh`
- Changing `CLAUDE_MODEL` and re-running `devloop init` regenerates both agent files with the new model
- Agent front matter (model field) uses an unquoted heredoc for variable expansion while the body uses a quoted heredoc to preserve literal `$` signs

**TodoWrite in orchestrator agent (FIX #8)**
- The `devloop-orchestrator` agent now lists `TodoWrite` in its tools
- Orchestrator tracks task progress with per-step todo items: Architect spec → Copilot implement → Review → Done

### Fixed

**`devloop daemon` subcommand argument parsing (FIX #4)**
- `stop`, `status`, `log`, and `uninstall` now work without specifying a project name: `devloop daemon stop`
- Previously required `devloop daemon <project-name> stop`
- Bare subcommands use the project name from `devloop.config.sh`

**Fenced code block extraction with language tags (FIX #2)**
- Copilot Instructions Block extraction and fix instruction extraction now match ```` ``` ```` with or without a language identifier (e.g. ```` ```python ````)
- Previously only matched bare ```` ``` ```` lines, causing extraction to silently return empty on language-tagged blocks

**`devloop clean` "preserved" message when count = 0 (FIX #13)**
- When no specs are old enough to clean but some are skipped (pending/needs-work), now prints:
  `"No finalized specs removed, N pending/needs-work preserved"`
- Previously only printed the generic "none found" message, hiding the fact that tasks were preserved

**bash 3.2 heredoc compatibility in `cmd_review`**
- Replaced `review_prompt="$(cat <<HEREDOC...HEREDOC)"` with a `mktemp` + `printf` approach
- The old pattern caused `"bad substitution: no closing ')'"` on macOS bash 3.2 when the git diff contained backtick characters (common in markdown code blocks in agent `.md` files)

**`cmd_review` output capture under `set -euo pipefail`**
- Replaced `echo ... | claude -p | tee "$review_file"` with `echo ... | claude -p > "$review_file" && cat "$review_file"`
- The `tee` pipeline's exit code was unreliable under `pipefail`, causing the review file to never be written

### Changed

- `devloop init` skips existing files instead of overwriting — safe to re-run after config changes
- `devloop architect` writes the extracted Copilot block to `.devloop/prompts/TASK-ID-copilot.txt` for use by `devloop block`
- `devloop tasks` output updated to show seconds in task IDs
- Orchestrator agent workflow updated with `TodoWrite` tracking steps and clearer phase indicators
